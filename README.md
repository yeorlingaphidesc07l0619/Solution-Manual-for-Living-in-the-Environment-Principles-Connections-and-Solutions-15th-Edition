The resulting texts are shorter, clearer, and so engaging that your students will actually want to read their assignments. The Fifteenth Edition's engaging, streamlined coverage includes over 4,000 updates and new topics; hundreds of new "Thinking About" exercises that engage students in critical thinking about environmental science topics; "Core Case Studies" that reinforce chapter concepts; 127 new photos; and superb, integrated coverage of sustainability!
